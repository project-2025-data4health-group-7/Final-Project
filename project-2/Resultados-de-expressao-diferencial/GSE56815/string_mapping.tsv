278	7850	9606.ENSP00000330959	IL1R2	Interleukin-1 receptor type 2, membrane form; Non-signaling receptor for IL1A, IL1B and IL1RN. Reduces IL1B activities. Serves as a decoy receptor by competetive binding to IL1B and preventing its binding to IL1R1. Also modulates cellular response through non-signaling association with IL1RAP after binding to IL1B. IL1R2 (membrane and secreted forms) preferentially binds IL1B and poorly IL1A and IL1RN. The secreted IL1R2 recruits secreted IL1RAP with high affinity; this complex formation may be the dominant mechanism for neutralization of IL1B by secreted/soluble receptors.

339	9586	9606.ENSP00000350359	CREB5	Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 5; Binds to the cAMP response element and activates transcription.
340	9592	9606.ENSP00000465617	IER2	Immediate early response gene 2 protein; DNA-binding protein that seems to act as a transcription factor. Involved in the regulation of neuronal differentiation, acts upon JNK-signaling pathway activation and plays a role in neurite outgrowth in hippocampal cells (By similarity). May mediate with FIBP FGF-signaling in the establishment of laterality in the embryo (By similarity). Promotes cell motility, seems to stimulate tumor metastasis. ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q6P7D3, ; Belongs to the IER family.
341	9595	9606.ENSP00000264192	CYTIP	Cytohesin-interacting protein; By its binding to cytohesin-1 (CYTH1), it modifies activation of ARFs by CYTH1 and its precise function may be to sequester CYTH1 in the cytoplasm.
342	9605	9606.ENSP00000374037	VPS9D1	VPS9 domain containing 1.
343	9652	9606.ENSP00000497948	TTC37	Tetratricopeptide repeat protein 37; Component of the SKI complex which is thought to be involved in exosome-mediated RNA decay and associates with transcriptionally active genes in a manner dependent on PAF1 complex (PAF1C).
344	968	9606.ENSP00000250092	CD68	Macrosialin; Could play a role in phagocytic activities of tissue macrophages, both in intracellular lysosomal metabolism and extracellular cell-cell and cell-pathogen interactions. Binds to tissue- and organ-specific lectins or selectins, allowing homing of macrophage subsets to particular sites. Rapid recirculation of CD68 from endosomes and lysosomes to the plasma membrane may allow macrophages to crawl over selectin-bearing substrates or other cells.
345	9690	9606.ENSP00000309198	UBE3C	Ubiquitin-protein ligase E3C; E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that accepts ubiquitin from the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2D1 in the form of a thioester and then directly transfers the ubiquitin to targeted substrates. Can assemble unanchored poly-ubiquitin chains in either 'Lys-29'- or 'Lys- 48'-linked polyubiquitin chains. Has preference for 'Lys-48' linkages. It can target itself for ubiquitination in vitro and may promote its own degradation in vivo.
346	9759	9606.ENSP00000264606	HDAC4	Histone deacetylase 4; Responsible for the deacetylation of lysine residues on the N-terminal part of the core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4). Histone deacetylation gives a tag for epigenetic repression and plays an important role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression and developmental events. Histone deacetylases act via the formation of large multiprotein complexes. Involved in muscle maturation via its interaction with the myocyte enhancer factors such as MEF2A, MEF2C and MEF2D. Involved in the MTA1-mediated epigenetic regulation of ESR1 expression in breast cancer.  [...] 
347	9839	9606.ENSP00000487174	ZEB2	Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2; Transcriptional inhibitor that binds to DNA sequence 5'- CACCT-3' in different promoters. Represses transcription of E-cadherin.
348	9874	9606.ENSP00000411099	TLK1	Serine/threonine-protein kinase tousled-like 1; Rapidly and transiently inhibited by phosphorylation following the generation of DNA double-stranded breaks during S-phase. This is cell cycle checkpoint and ATM-pathway dependent and appears to regulate processes involved in chromatin assembly. Isoform 3 phosphorylates and enhances the stability of the t-SNARE SNAP23, augmenting its assembly with syntaxin. Isoform 3 protects the cells from the ionizing radiation by facilitating the repair of DSBs. In vitro, phosphorylates histone H3 at 'Ser-10'. Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. [...] 
349	9958	9606.ENSP00000280377	USP15	Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 15; Hydrolase that removes conjugated ubiquitin from target proteins and regulates various pathways such as the TGF-beta receptor signaling, NF-kappa-B and RNF41/NRDP1-PRKN pathways. Acts as a key regulator of TGF-beta receptor signaling pathway, but the precise mechanism is still unclear: according to a report, acts by promoting deubiquitination of monoubiquitinated R-SMADs (SMAD1, SMAD2 and/or SMAD3), thereby alleviating inhibition of R-SMADs and promoting activation of TGF-beta target genes. According to another reports, regulates the TGF-beta r [...] 
350	9988	9606.ENSP00000378193	DMTF1	Cyclin-D-binding Myb-like transcription factor 1; Transcriptional activator which activates the CDKN2A/ARF locus in response to Ras-Raf signaling, thereby promoting p53/TP53- dependent growth arrest (By similarity). Binds to the consensus sequence 5'-CCCG[GT]ATGT-3' (By similarity). Isoform 1 may cooperate with MYB to activate transcription of the ANPEP gene. Isoform 2 may antagonize transcriptional activation by isoform 1.
